Write in your own words the following:
Question 1: What are 3 things node.js has that the client side javascript doesn’t have?
Answer: 
1. "global" object - global objects are global in nature and they are available in all modules. 
   We do not need to include these objects in our application, rather we can use them directly. 
   These objects are modules, functions, strings and object itself.
2. Node.js has full access to the system like any other source application. 
   This means it can read and write directly to or from the file system, 
   it can also have unlimited network access, and it can execute software.
3. Node.js has a dedicated server to run server-side requests, whereas JavaScript does not. 
   if we use Node.js, both the server and the client can initiate requests. 


What are 3 things the client side javascript has that node.js doesn’t have?
Answer:
1. The ability to be used in both frontend and backend, whereas Node.js can be used only for the backend.
2. JavaScript can manipulate DOM or add HTML within whereas Node.js doesn’t have the capability to add HTML.
3. JavaScript requires any running environment as it can execute on any engine such as Firefox’s spider monkey, 
   v8 engine of google chrome, JavaScript core of Safari whereas Node.js runs only on the v8 engine of google chrome.
